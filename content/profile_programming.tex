{
  Doctoral student at Imperial College London with experience in the analysis of data
  from the LHCb detector, which is located on the Large Hadron Collider.
  Used a variety of computational and statistical techniques to analyse these datasets.
  I am motivated my programming in general, but I would find the opportunity to use these skills to
  solve problems and analyse interesting data particularly rewarding.
  Good work ethic, problem solving skills, quick at adapting to new problems working as part of a
  team or independently.
