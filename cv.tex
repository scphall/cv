    \sc Profile	&
    I am on track for excellent results in my MPhys in theoretical physics from
    Durham University, and have worked in industry for a leading technology
    consultancy.  The latter experience has shown me the importance of physics in
    industry and given me the opportunity to work collaboratively, both as part of
    a team and as an individual.  I believe that my success in academia is because
    I am hard working and diligent.  I have very high standards and am motivated
    by my interest in the subject, which makes study all the more enjoyable.  My
    natural aptitude for organisation and leadership has been improved captaining
    two college teams.  I am a high academic achiever and am engaged in a range of
    extracurricular activities.
