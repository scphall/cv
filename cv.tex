	\sc Profile	&	
	I am on track for excellent results in my MPhys in theoretical physics from Durham University, and have worked in industry for a leading technology consultancy.  The latter experience has shown me the importance of physics in industry and given me the opportunity to work collaboratively, both as part of a team and as an individual.  I believe that my success in academia is because I am hard working and diligent.  I have very high standards and am motivated by my interest in the subject, which makes study all the more enjoyable.  My natural aptitude for organisation and leadership has been improved captaining two college teams.  I am a high academic achiever and am engaged in a range of extracurricular activities.
